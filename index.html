          <h2>Meet our founder</h2>
          <!-- Glenn’s story emphasizes resilience, advocacy, and a commitment to student success. -->
          <p><strong>Glenn Smith‑Perrot</strong> grew up in Brooklyn, NY, and spent part of his childhood in foster care. He used education as a path to change his life and is committed to making sure others have the same opportunity.</p>
          <p>Serving as a Youth Ambassador for Pennsylvania’s Child Welfare Resource Center, Glenn represented the northeastern region and travelled across the state to share his foster‑care experiences, highlight effective practices, and mentor youth considering college. He even spoke twice at Pennsylvania’s State‑Wide Adoption Network conference.</p>
          <p>At New York University’s Stern School of Business, he became Assistant Director of the Berkley Achievement Scholar Program. In that role he oversaw daily operations, collaborated with faculty, corporate partners and alumni to provide resources and one‑on‑one coaching, and helped achieve 100 percent retention among scholars. He launched the Scholar Engagement and Leadership Committee, trained peer mentors, and organized experiential learning like site visits and financial literacy workshops to prepare students for long‑term success.</p>
          <p>Earlier in his career, Glenn served as a Student Success &amp; Financial Education Specialist and StudentLink counselor at NYU, where he developed financial literacy workshops, provided academic coaching and offered case management to help students overcome challenges and graduate. He is also a Birkman‑certified consultant and an IDI‑qualified administrator. Through these certifications he offers leadership development and team‑building sessions to help people understand behavioural strengths and improve cross‑cultural communication.</p>
          <p>Today he leads <em>Smith‑Perrot Education Services</em>, channeling his experience and advocacy for equitable access into personalized coaching, academic planning, financial literacy and leadership development for families, students and organizations.</p>
